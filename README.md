## Session Information

### DuPSUG Announcements

Informational session about the event, agenda of the evening future events and updates from the PowerShell world.

### Building your first VSCode extension

VS Code with the PowerShell extension is the de facto standard editor for PowerShell. One of the best things about VS Code is how customizable it is. Anybody can create themes and extensions for Code, and in this demo-heavy session, you‚Äôll learn how you can join the fun, too. Whether you want to deploy a small extension to help your team stay productive, you have an amazing idea for an extension that the public will celebrate for years, or you want to contribute to the PowerShell extension, in this session you‚Äôll learn the skills and tools you need to get going. We‚Äôre going to write a VS Code extension starting from scratch, examining the different resources in place to help you along your journey as we go.

### Power Up Your Shell!

Windows Terminal is nearing its 1.0 release and Justin Grote will be showing off neat tricks for both new and advanced users. Justin will also provide insight on customizing your prompt experience with PSReadline and prompt customizations, which will work on any platform, so there‚Äôs something here for everyone!

### Open Discussion

During our last virtual meetup we naturally ended up being a group discussion on future topics for virtual meetings, issues with PowerShell and a show-and-tell about anything PowerShell related. So if you have any specific question or you can‚Äôt wait to show what you‚Äôve been working on we‚Äôre happy to give you the platform to do so.
